# CobbleCustomItems
Add custom items to minecraft can be a bit tricky,
so this project allows us to easily add custom items
that can be quickly hot swapped. with custom abilities.

## How it works
An item lore is set with a custom uuid and on
a packet level we inject display name, lore and 
other information.

Note: while in creative, you can view the items by their ids
